# Track Ease

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. 

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
